# Redmine Another My Projects

## Overview

This is an alternative implementation to the my project plugin.  It varies from
other versions in that it uses the standard redmine project list interface.  The
project list sidebar will have a link to choose between viewing all projects and
viewing only a user's projects.  If the user changes views, it will be 
remembered in a session store.  The default value is added as an account 
setting.

It is written for Redmine 2.3.x and tested on 2.2.x, other versions may or may 
not work.
